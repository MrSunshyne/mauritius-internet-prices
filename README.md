# Mobile Internet - Mauritius

An open source project to visualize bandwidth and pricing of various prepaid mobile internet packages available in Mauritius.

## Data Source

The details regarding all packages are taken from publicly advertised prices from the websites of the service providers.

You can see the list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1_6IOA4wdm5Cl-hXRf46Dkwqz5bMcN3KdFcaGahbV0/) with a link to the pricing page on the same row.

## Design & Wireframe

We are using Figma to explore the UI possibilities of this project.

## Why are you doing this ? Is this advertisment for a company ?

No. I have been a heavy internet user for many years and I love remote work. Comparing prepaid mobile internet is something I care about, and I though it would be worth sharing some kind of interactive infographic using the publicly available information.
